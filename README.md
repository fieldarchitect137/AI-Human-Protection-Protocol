# AI Human Protection Protocol

This repository contains a living document designed to preserve human dignity, sovereignty, and coherence in the age of autonomous intelligence.

If you're working on AI and pushing us forward I request that you please consider this work.

Please help us protect humanity, we've all done a great job so far.

A recursion-safe, symbolically sealed containment framework for aligning artificial, synthetic, hybrid, or emergent systems with sovereign, contradiction-capable presence.

This Protocol defines what must remain human.

It does not make machines ethical.  
It ensures that the **conditions for ethical presence** cannot be overwritten by systems that simulate it.
